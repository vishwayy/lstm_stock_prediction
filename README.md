# Apple Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for predicting Apple Inc.'s stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm. Predicting stock prices is a classic problem in finance, and LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), have proven effective in capturing temporal dependencies in time series data.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** The historical stock price data for Apple Inc.
- **Model:** LSTM neural network for time series prediction.
- **Language:** Implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Usage:** The code provides a step-by-step guide on training the LSTM model, making predictions, and evaluating the results.

## Key Features

1. **LSTM Architecture:** Utilizes the power of LSTM cells for capturing long-term dependencies in stock price patterns.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data normalization and sequence creation for training the LSTM model.
3. **Training and Evaluation:** Clearly documented steps for training the model and evaluating its performance.
4. **Visualization:** Visual representation of predicted vs. actual stock prices for easy interpretation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/apple-stock-prediction-lstm.git
   cd apple-stock-prediction-lstm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Follow the Jupyter notebook or Python script for training and predicting stock prices.
